# truffle-react-vote
This React Application client is coupled with blockchain Smart Contract Ethereum  
Smart Contract : Voting
# 

## What to do to activate the development environment
- Start Ganache or Geth to own private blockchain
- Set ***truffle-config.js*** to declare Ganache network
- Compile project with : truffle deploy --reset --network ganache
- Remember that the deployed contract address can be found in file ./client/src/contract/voting.json
- Backend is ready
- on client directory
- run project with : yarn start

# 
plus : It's a good idea to start remix with remixd on this project contract directory to interact with the testing/developpement contract
